# mental_health_companion

Mental health is an important issue in this world today. As 
now in these troubling times of Covid 19 a large amount of 
population worldwide is now doing work from their homes 
and is staying away from their loved ones, almost everyone’s 
mental health situation has deteriorated. So, it becomes 
important to track and solve any mental health issues before 
they get serious. I’m trying to achieve this using this Mental 
Health Companion App. 
This companion app has been made keeping in mind that the 
app’s users would be suffering from some sort of mental 
illness and generally not keen to engage/spent much time with 
an app, hence this app is designed to be very user friendly 
with its UI being easy to use and with welcoming color 
schemes. 

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

### IMPORTANT:

For projects with Firestore integration, you must first run the following commands to ensure the project compiles:

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This command creates the generated files that parse each Record from Firestore into a schema object.

### Getting started continued:

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
